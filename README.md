# Lahka Blockchain

Lahka is an experimental, modular blockchain platform designed to explore next-generation consensus and incentive mechanisms. It features a unique Proof of Contribution Stake (PoCS) system that rewards not just financial stake, but also real, measurable contributions to the network and community.

## Key Features
- **Proof of Contribution Stake (PoCS):** Multi-dimensional validator selection based on stake, reliability, reputation, diversity, and actual network contributions.
- **Contribution Mining:** Earn credits for valuable activities (code audits, documentation, bug reports, community support) and convert them to stake.
- **Dynamic Penalties & Rehabilitation:** Validators are penalized for misbehavior but can rehabilitate through positive contributions.
- **Reputation & Peer Review:** Validators rate each other, influencing reputation and selection.
- **Smart Contracts:** Deploy and interact with simple smart contracts.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Caching, dynamic weights, and network health metrics for scalable operation.
